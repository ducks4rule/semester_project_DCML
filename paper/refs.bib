abstract={Tonality is one of the most central theoretical concepts for the analysis of Western classical music. This study presents a novel approach for the study of its historical development, exploring in particular the concept of mode. Based on a large dataset of approximately 13,000 musical pieces in MIDI format, we present two models to infer both the number and characteristics of modes of different historical periods from first principles: a geometric model of modes as clusters of musical pieces in a non-Euclidean space, and a cognitively plausible Bayesian model of modes as Dirichlet distributions. We use the geometric model to determine the optimal number of modes for five historical epochs via unsupervised learning and apply the probabilistic model to infer the characteristics of the modes. Our results show that the inference of four modes is most plausible in the Renaissance, that two modes--corresponding to major and minor--are most appropriate in the Baroque and Classical eras, whereas no clear separation into distinct modes is found for the 19th century.},

@article{Lieck2020,
 abstract = {Pitch-class distributions are of central relevance in music information retrieval, computational musicology and various other fields, such as music perception and cognition. However, despite their structure being closely related to the cognitively and musically relevant properties of a piece, many existing approaches treat pitch-class distributions as fixed templates.In this paper, we introduce the Tonal Diffusion Model, which provides a more structured and interpretable statistical model of pitch-class distributions by incorporating geometric and algebraic structures known from music theory as well as insights from music cognition. Our model explains the pitch-class distributions of musical pieces by assuming tones to be generated through a latent cognitive process on the Tonnetz, a well-established representation for harmonic relations. Specifically, we assume that all tones in a piece are generated by taking a sequence of interval steps on the Tonnetz starting from a unique tonal origin. We provide a description in terms of a Bayesian generative model and show how the latent variables and parameters can be efficiently inferred.The model is quantitatively evaluated on a corpus of 248 pieces from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic era and describes the empirical pitch-class distributions more accurately than conventional template-based models. On three concrete musical examples, we demonstrate that our model captures relevant harmonic characteristics of the pieces in a compact and interpretable way, also reflecting stylistic aspects of the respective epoch.},

title = "Three conceptions of musical distance",
abstract = "This paper considers three conceptions of musical distance (or inverse {"}similarity{"}) that produce three different musico-geometrical spaces: the first, based on voice leading, yields a collection of continuous quotient spaces or orbifolds; the second, based on acoustics, gives rise to the Tonnetz and related {"}tuning lattices{"}; while the third, based on the total interval content of a group of notes, generates a six-dimensional {"}quality space{"} first described by Ian Quinn. I will show that although these three measures are in principle quite distinct, they are in practice surprisingly interrelated. This produces the challenge of determining which model is appropriate to a given music-theoretical circumstance. Since the different models can yield comparable results, unwary theorists could potentially find themselves using one type of structure (such as a tuning lattice) to investigate properties more perspicuously represented by another (for instance, voice-leading relationships).",

abstract="This paper compares two tokenization strategies for modeling chord progressions using the encoder transformer architecture trained with a large dataset of chord progressions in a variety of styles. The first strategy includes a tokenization method treating all different chords as unique elements, which results in a vocabulary of 5202 independent tokens. The second strategy expresses the chords as a dynamic tuple describing root, nature (e.g., major, minor, diminished, etc.), and extensions (e.g., additions or alterations), producing a specific vocabulary of 59 tokens related to chords and 75 tokens for style, bars, form, and format. In the second approach, MIDI embeddings are added into the positional embedding layer of the transformer architecture, with an array of eight values related to the notes forming the chords. We propose a trigram analysis addition to the dataset to compare the generated chord progressions with the training dataset, which reveals common progressions and the extent to which a sequence is duplicated. We analyze progressions generated by the models comparing HITS@k metrics and human evaluation of 10 participants, rating the plausibility of the progressions as potential music compositions from a musical perspective. The second model reported lower validation loss, better metrics, and more musical consistency in the suggested progressions.",
