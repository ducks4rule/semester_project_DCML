\section{Models}

\subsection{Simple Markov Chain Model}
In order to establish a baseline, we first consider a simple Markov chain model. The model is fitted on the chords of one Beethoven string quartet.
The probabilities in the matrix simply represent the frequency of the transitions between the chords. Bis sampling from the matrix, we can generate a new chord according to the previous one.
